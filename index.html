		<p class="message">I‚Äôm so so heartbroken and sad and blue and devastated, I can‚Äôt be there to shower you with all the love and big birthday drama you deserve, but I hope you are spending today celebrating, living your best life in our favourite place ever. (With a salmon bagel from Pom Pom ofc) Your positivity and good faith in the world is such a precious gift to you and to everyone around you. And I can only hope that one day it‚Äôll rub off on me. You are so kind and genuinely the most selfless person I‚Äôve ever known, I‚Äôm so grateful that I got to grow up next to you and look up to you everyday. I LOVE that we‚Äôre sisters and I LOVE it even more that we‚Äôre FRIENDS. Not many are as lucky us to find a friend in their siblings and I couldn‚Äôt be more thankful that that could never be us üòåüíÖ You have so so so so many people that love and adore you and I really hope you can feel all of it. I love you so much and CANT WAIT FOR YOU TO COME HOME so we can live together again!!!! I know this next chapter is going to be strange, moving back to Sydney and trying to figure out where to go and what to do next but HOW EXCITING that you get to start all over again and decide where you want to be and where you want life to take you. I can‚Äôt wait to see what you do. I hope this next year, and next quarter of your life brings you as much joy and love as you give to everyone around you.</p>
            
	<p>With love, from your adoring little sister ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
